# Synergy

**Synergy** is a social media platform where users can share their love for nature. The platform allows users to post their personal nature-related photos, like and comment on other users' posts, and engage with a community that shares a passion for the environment. This project was developed as part of my Full Stack Developer internship at CodeAlpha.

## Project Overview

The platform is simple yet powerful, focusing on core social media functionalities without overwhelming users with unnecessary features. It offers a clean and intuitive interface where users can easily navigate and interact with posts.
